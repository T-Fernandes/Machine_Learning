Dataset: [spambase.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

Algorithms used:

- k-nearest neighbors (kNN)
- Artificial Neural Networks (RNA)
- Naive Bayes (NB)
- Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)

**Conclusion**: Among the four classifiers, the RNA was the best one, with an accuracy of **0.925**, in contrast, the classifier that least adapted to the data was the NB with accuracy of **0.686**.
