Dataset: [spambase.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

Algorithms used:

- k-nearest neighbors (kNN)
- Artificial Neural Networks (RNA)
- Naive Bayes (NB)
- Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)

**Conclusion**: Among the four classifiers, the RNA was the best one, with an accuracy of **0.925**, in contrast, the classifier that least adapted to the data was the NB with accuracy of **0.686**.

Dataset: [mushroom.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

Algorithms used:

- Decision tree (AD)
- Random Forests (RF)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression (RL)

**Conclusion**: Among the four classifiers, the RF and SVM were the best, with precision of **1,000**, in contrast, the classifier that had the least precision was the AD with the value of **0.989**.
